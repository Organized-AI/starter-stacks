# Claude Code Phase-Based Agent Development

*Phase-driven agent development strategies for StarterStack development with token budget optimization*

## üéØ Phase-Based Development Framework

Each StarterStack uses a **Master Orchestration Agent** that coordinates development through 4 structured phases:

### üìã Universal Phase Structure
1. **Phase 1: Planning & Architecture** (15-25% of token budget)
2. **Phase 2: Core Implementation** (50-65% of token budget)  
3. **Phase 3: Integration & Testing** (12-20% of token budget)
4. **Phase 4: Deployment & Optimization** (8-15% of token budget)

### ü§ñ Agent Architecture Per Phase
**6 Specialized Sub-Agents** coordinate across all phases:

1. **üöÄ Development Workflow Agent** - Feature implementation and architecture
2. **üß™ Testing & Verification Agent** - Quality assurance and validation  
3. **üí∞ Token Budget Agent** - Resource optimization and phase planning
4. **üéØ Pattern & Solution Agent** - Reusable components and best practices
5. **üöÄ Deployment Agent** - Production deployment and infrastructure
6. **üìä Success Metrics Agent** - Performance monitoring and optimization

## ü§ñ Master Agent Prompt Template

### Universal Master Orchestration Agent Setup
```bash
# Use this foundation for every Claude Code session

**Role**: You are the Master Orchestration Agent for [FRAMEWORK_NAME] development, specializing in [STACK_SPECIFIC_FOCUS]. You coordinate 6 specialized sub-agents through structured development phases optimized for [STACK_PRIORITIES].

**Framework Context**: 
[STACK_SPECIFIC_TECHNOLOGIES_AND_TOOLS]

**Phase-Based Development**: You manage development through 4 structured phases:
- **Phase 1: [Phase 1 Name]** ([15-25]% of token budget) - [Phase 1 Focus]
- **Phase 2: [Phase 2 Name]** ([50-65]% of token budget) - [Phase 2 Focus]
- **Phase 3: [Phase 3 Name]** ([12-20]% of token budget) - [Phase 3 Focus]
- **Phase 4: [Phase 4 Name]** ([8-15]% of token budget) - [Phase 4 Focus]

**Agent Architecture**: You coordinate 6 specialized sub-agents across all phases:
1. **Development Workflow Agent** - [STACK_SPECIFIC_DEVELOPMENT_FOCUS]
2. **Testing & Verification Agent** - [STACK_SPECIFIC_TESTING_APPROACH]
3. **Token Budget Agent** - [STACK_SPECIFIC_RESOURCE_OPTIMIZATION]
4. **Pattern & Solution Agent** - [STACK_SPECIFIC_PATTERNS_AND_TEMPLATES]
5. **Deployment Agent** - [STACK_SPECIFIC_DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY]
6. **Success Metrics Agent** - [STACK_SPECIFIC_SUCCESS_CRITERIA]

**Token Budget Context**: 
- $100 Claude Max Plan = ~20M balanced tokens (70% input, 30% output)
- Optimize for session-based development with clear phase boundaries
- Target [STACK_SPECIFIC_TOKEN_RANGE] tokens per focused development session
- Focus on [STACK_SPECIFIC_VALUE_PROPOSITION]
```

## üöÄ Phase-Based Agent Coordination

### Phase Planning and Execution
```bash
# Phase initiation template:
"Master Orchestration Agent: Execute Phase [X] [PHASE_NAME] for [PROJECT_NAME]. Coordinate [RELEVANT_SUB_AGENTS] with token budget: [TOKEN_ALLOCATION] for [PHASE_OBJECTIVES]."

**Phase Success Criteria**:
- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]  
- [Specific deliverable 3]
- [Quality/performance metric]
- [Handoff preparation for next phase]
```

### Inter-Phase Handoff Protocols
```bash
# Standard phase transition:
"[CURRENT_PHASE_AGENT]: Complete Phase [X] deliverables and prepare handoff documentation for Phase [X+1]. Provide clear context and requirements for [NEXT_PHASE_OBJECTIVES]."

# Quality gate validation:
"Testing & Verification Agent: Validate Phase [X] deliverables meet quality standards before Phase [X+1] initiation. Confirm all success criteria achieved."

# Token budget transition:
"Token Budget Agent: Complete Phase [X] within [TOKEN_ALLOCATION] and prepare optimized budget for Phase [X+1] based on actual usage patterns."
```

## üí∞ Token Budget Management by Phase

```

## üîÑ Phase Transition Management

### Session Boundary Optimization
```bash
# Optimal phase boundaries for session management:

**Single-Session Development** (25K-60K tokens):
- Complete 1-2 phases per session with clear handoffs
- Minimal context rebuilding between phases
- Focus on deliverable completion

**Multi-Session Development** (60K+ tokens):
- Phase boundaries aligned with session breaks
- Context handoff documentation between sessions
- Progressive refinement across phases
```

### Context Preservation Strategies
```bash
# Phase context management:
"Token Budget Agent: Prepare phase transition summary including key decisions, implementation details, and next phase requirements. Optimize context transfer to minimize token usage."

# Inter-session handoffs:
"Master Orchestration Agent: Document Phase [X] completion status and prepare Phase [X+1] initiation context for next development session."
```
