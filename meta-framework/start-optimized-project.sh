## Pattern DNA Synthesis

### From BMAD Framework:
- Token Usage Master Plan principles
- Subagent orchestration patterns
- Deployment success checklist

### From Knowledge Base:
- 41-53% token optimization patterns
- Parallel execution strategies
- Master Orchestrator architecture

## Compound Efficiency Target: 67-83%

## Implementation Strategy:
1. Front-loaded design phase (BMAD principle)
2. Parallel sub-agent execution (KB pattern)
3. Continuous metric feedback (Symbiosis protocol)

## Success Metrics:
- [ ] First-attempt deployment success
- [ ] Token usage under optimization threshold
- [ ] Pattern contribution back to frameworks

*This project is born from the symbiosis of proven patterns.*
