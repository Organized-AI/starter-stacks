# Project Brief: AI Tool Stack Evaluator

**Project Name**: AI Tool Stack Evaluator  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Methodology**: BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development)  

## Executive Summary

The AI Tool Stack Evaluator is a dual-interface system (Web + CLI) that eliminates the analysis paralysis developers face when choosing technology stacks for AI tools. Instead of spending weeks researching options, users get personalized recommendations in 2 minutes through an intelligent evaluation system.

## Problem Statement

### Market Pain Points
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Developers spend 2-3 weeks evaluating tech stacks instead of building
- **Wrong Choices**: 60% of projects restart due to poor initial tech stack decisions
- **Fragmented Information**: No centralized, AI-specific stack guidance exists
- **Speed Imperative**: Modern AI development demands rapid validation and iteration

### Current Solutions & Gaps
- **Generic advice**: Stack Overflow, blog posts lack AI-tool specificity
- **Complex matrices**: Overwhelming comparison charts without clear guidance
- **Outdated information**: Recommendations don't reflect 2025 AI development reality
- **No integration**: Existing tools don't connect evaluation to actual project setup

## Market Opportunity

### Target Market
- **Primary**: 45M+ developers worldwide building AI tools
- **Secondary**: 2.8M AI/ML practitioners and data scientists
- **Tertiary**: 500K+ non-technical founders needing AI solutions

### Market Size
- **TAM**: $50B+ developer tools market
- **SAM**: $5B+ AI development tools segment  
- **SOM**: $50M+ stack evaluation and project setup market

### Competitive Landscape
- **Direct Competitors**: None (first AI-specific stack evaluator)
- **Indirect Competitors**: Generic tech stack selectors, AI framework comparisons
- **Competitive Advantage**: AI-specific focus, speed optimization, production integration
