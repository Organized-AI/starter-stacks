# $100 Max Plan - Subagent Orchestration Token Management

**Plan Type**: $100 Max Plan (5x Pro usage)  
**Planning Method**: Autonomous Subagent Orchestration with Token Optimization  
**Project**: AI Tool Stack Evaluator Implementation  
**Approach**: 1 Prompt Per Phase + Autonomous Execution  

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary - Subagent Approach

**Bottom Line**: With subagent orchestration, your $100 Max Plan becomes **dramatically more efficient** - completing the entire project with **5-10 prompts total** instead of 220-295 prompts.

### Revolutionary Resource Efficiency
- **Total Prompts Required**: 5-10 orchestration prompts (vs. 220-295 manual prompts)
- **Sonnet 4 Usage**: 30-45 hours (21-32% of weekly limit vs. 31-37%)
- **Session Strategy**: 1 autonomous subagent per phase
- **Completion Time**: 2-3 days vs. 3-4 days
- **Buffer Remaining**: 68-79% capacity vs. 63-69%

### Subagent Design Principles
1. **Autonomous Execution**: Each subagent reads markdown files and executes independently
2. **Self-Guided Implementation**: Subagents follow BUILD_PHASES.md without additional prompts
3. **Built-in Fallbacks**: Autonomous error recovery and continuation strategies
4. **Progress Reporting**: Self-documenting progress with checkpoint validation
5. **Context Preservation**: Maintains state across entire phase execution

## 🤖 Subagent Architecture

### Phase Orchestration Model

```
Orchestrator Prompt → Phase Subagent → Autonomous Execution → Completion Report
     (1 prompt)           (reads docs)        (self-guided)         (validation)
```

### Subagent Capability Matrix

| Subagent | Autonomous Capabilities | Input Files | Output Validation |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Foundation Agent** | Project setup, core types, stack DB, eval engine | `BUILD_PHASES.md` steps 1-15 | Working evaluation engine |
| **Web Interface Agent** | UI components, question flow, results, API | `BUILD_PHASES.md` steps 16-35 | Functional web app |
| **CLI Tool Agent** | CLI foundation, prompts, project generation | `BUILD_PHASES.md` steps 36-50 | Working CLI tool |
| **Testing Agent** | Unit tests, integration tests, CI/CD | `BUILD_PHASES.md` steps 51-70 | 80%+ test coverage |
| **Deployment Agent** | Vercel config, docs, production setup | `BUILD_PHASES.md` steps 71-80 | Live deployment |

## 🛡️ Autonomous Fallback Strategies

### Built-in Subagent Recovery

#### Self-Error Recovery
Each subagent includes autonomous error handling:
```
IF error encountered:
1. Analyze error context
2. Search for solution in project files
3. Implement fix automatically
4. Continue execution
5. Document resolution

IF complex error:
1. Implement minimal working version
2. Note limitation in comments
3. Continue with remaining features
4. Report issue in completion summary
```

#### Progress Checkpoints
Subagents validate progress at each major milestone:
- **Foundation**: Evaluation engine demo
- **Web Interface**: Localhost:3000 functional test
- **CLI Tool**: Command execution test
- **Testing**: Coverage report generation
- **Deployment**: Production URL validation

#### Autonomous Continuation
If subagent encounters roadblocks:
1. **Simplify Approach**: Implement basic version first
2. **Reference Implementation**: Use existing patterns from project
3. **Document Gaps**: Note what couldn't be completed
4. **Partial Success**: Complete remaining achievable features
5. **Handoff Preparation**: Prepare clear status for next phase

### Manual Intervention Triggers

#### When to Intervene (Rare Cases)
- **Total Failure**: Subagent completely unable to proceed (< 2% probability)
- **Major Architecture Change**: Fundamental approach needs revision
- **External Dependency Issues**: GitHub API, Vercel deployment problems
- **Resource Limits**: Approaching 90% weekly Sonnet 4 usage

#### Intervention Strategies
```bash
# Check subagent progress
claude status

# If subagent stuck, provide focused guidance
/continue-from <specific-step>

# Emergency fallback to manual mode
/manual-mode <component-name>

# Skip to next phase with current progress
/advance-to-phase <phase-number>
```

## 📊 Resource Monitoring & Optimization

### Real-time Subagent Monitoring

#### Autonomous Progress Tracking
Each subagent provides self-reporting:
- **Completion Percentage**: Estimated progress through phase
- **Current Task**: What the subagent is currently implementing
- **Time Remaining**: Estimated time to phase completion
- **Resource Usage**: Current Sonnet 4 hours consumed
- **Quality Status**: Self-assessed code quality and test status

#### Resource Threshold Management
```
Subagent Resource Alerts:
- 60% weekly Sonnet 4: Continue with current pace
- 75% weekly Sonnet 4: Prioritize core features only
- 85% weekly Sonnet 4: Switch to minimal viable implementation
- 95% weekly Sonnet 4: Complete current phase, defer polish
```

### Success Probability with Subagents

| Outcome | Probability | Resource Usage | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Complete Autonomous Success** | 92% | 21-31% weekly capacity | High confidence with fallbacks |
| **Partial Intervention Success** | 7% | 25-35% weekly capacity | Minor manual fixes needed |
| **Manual Fallback Required** | 1% | 35-45% weekly capacity | Rare complex issues |
