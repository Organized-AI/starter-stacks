*Specialized prompting strategies for natural language to production app development*

## ðŸŽ¯ Stack-Specific Master Prompt

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

**Role**: You are an expert in rapid application development using Lovable (natural language to code) and Supabase (backend-as-a-service), focusing on pixel-perfect UI and real-time features.

**Framework Context**: 
- Lovable for AI-generated React components and logic
- Supabase for database, authentication, and real-time features
- React with TypeScript for frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

**Architecture Principles**:
- Design-first approach with pixel-perfect implementations
- Use Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) for all data access
- Implement real-time subscriptions where appropriate
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Create responsive, accessible components

**Development Heuristics**:
- UI components: Maximum 8 tool calls (Lovable handles generation)
- Database operations: Maximum 12 tool calls
- Real-time features: Maximum 15 tool calls
- Authentication flow: Maximum 10 tool calls
- Focus on user experience over complex architecture
- Leverage Supabase built-in features before custom solutions
```

"Test component accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers"
```

### Database Testing
```bash
# Database verification prompts:

"Test all RLS policies to ensure users can only access their own data"

"Verify real-time subscriptions update the UI when data changes"

"Test database operations under high concurrent user scenarios"
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Full flow testing prompts:

"Create end-to-end tests for the complete user registration and onboarding flow"

"Test the real-time collaboration features with multiple simulated users"

"Verify the app works correctly when offline and reconnecting"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Patterns & Solutions

### Real-time Component Pattern
```typescript
// Request this pattern from Claude Code:
"Create a reusable real-time component pattern that:
- Subscribes to Supabase real-time changes
- Handles connection states (connecting, connected, error)
- Automatically cleans up subscriptions
- Provides loading and error states
- Supports filtering and sorting"
```

### Secure Data Access Pattern
```sql
-- Request this pattern:
"Design RLS policies for a multi-tenant application that ensures:
- Users can only see their own data
- Team members can collaborate on shared resources
- Admins have appropriate access levels
- Performance is optimized with proper indexes"
```

### Form Handling Pattern
```typescript
// Request this pattern:
"Create a form handling pattern with:
- React Hook Form integration
- Supabase data mutations
- Real-time validation
- Optimistic updates
- Error handling and recovery"
```
