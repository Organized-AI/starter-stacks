# Mid-session coordination:
"Master Orchestration Agent: Review progress on [CURRENT_TASK]. Coordinate handoffs between [CURRENT_AGENT] and [NEXT_AGENT]. Ensure token budget remains on track."

# Session completion:
"Master Orchestration Agent: Complete session for [FEATURE_NAME]. Coordinate with Success Metrics Agent for progress evaluation and prepare handoff documentation for next session."
```

### Emergency Protocols
```bash
# When over budget:
"Token Budget Agent: Current session exceeding planned token usage. Coordinate with Master Orchestration Agent to prioritize critical tasks and defer non-essential work to next session."

# When blocked:
"Master Orchestration Agent: [CURRENT_AGENT] is blocked on [SPECIFIC_ISSUE]. Coordinate with Pattern & Solution Agent for alternative approaches or delegate to different sub-agent."
