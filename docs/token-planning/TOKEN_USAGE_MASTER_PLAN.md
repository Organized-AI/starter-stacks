**Planning Method**: Autonomous Subagent Orchestration with Token Optimization  
**Project**: AI Tool Stack Evaluator Implementation  
**Approach**: 1 Prompt Per Phase + Autonomous Execution  

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary - Subagent Approach

**Bottom Line**: With subagent orchestration, your $100 Max Plan becomes **dramatically more efficient** - completing the entire project with **5-10 prompts total** instead of 220-295 prompts.

### Revolutionary Resource Efficiency
- **Total Prompts Required**: 5-10 orchestration prompts (vs. 220-295 manual prompts)
- **Sonnet 4 Usage**: 30-45 hours (21-32% of weekly limit vs. 31-37%)
- **Session Strategy**: 1 autonomous subagent per phase
- **Completion Time**: 2-3 days vs. 3-4 days
- **Buffer Remaining**: 68-79% capacity vs. 63-69%

### Subagent Design Principles
1. **Autonomous Execution**: Each subagent reads markdown files and executes independently
2. **Self-Guided Implementation**: Subagents follow BUILD_PHASES.md without additional prompts
3. **Built-in Fallbacks**: Autonomous error recovery and continuation strategies
4. **Progress Reporting**: Self-documenting progress with checkpoint validation
5. **Context Preservation**: Maintains state across entire phase execution

## 🛡️ Autonomous Fallback Strategies

### Built-in Subagent Recovery

#### Self-Error Recovery
Each subagent includes autonomous error handling:
```
IF error encountered:
1. Analyze error context
2. Search for solution in project files
3. Implement fix automatically
4. Continue execution
5. Document resolution

IF complex error:
1. Implement minimal working version
2. Note limitation in comments
3. Continue with remaining features
4. Report issue in completion summary
```

#### Progress Checkpoints
Subagents validate progress at each major milestone:
- **Foundation**: Evaluation engine demo
- **Web Interface**: Localhost:3000 functional test
- **CLI Tool**: Command execution test
- **Testing**: Coverage report generation
- **Deployment**: Production URL validation

#### Autonomous Continuation
If subagent encounters roadblocks:
1. **Simplify Approach**: Implement basic version first
2. **Reference Implementation**: Use existing patterns from project
3. **Document Gaps**: Note what couldn't be completed
4. **Partial Success**: Complete remaining achievable features
5. **Handoff Preparation**: Prepare clear status for next phase

### Manual Intervention Triggers

#### When to Intervene (Rare Cases)
- **Total Failure**: Subagent completely unable to proceed (< 2% probability)
- **Major Architecture Change**: Fundamental approach needs revision
- **External Dependency Issues**: GitHub API, Vercel deployment problems
- **Resource Limits**: Approaching 90% weekly Sonnet 4 usage

#### Intervention Strategies
```bash
# Check subagent progress
claude status

# If subagent stuck, provide focused guidance
/continue-from <specific-step>

# Emergency fallback to manual mode
/manual-mode <component-name>

# Skip to next phase with current progress
/advance-to-phase <phase-number>
```

## 📊 Resource Monitoring & Optimization

### Real-time Subagent Monitoring

#### Autonomous Progress Tracking
Each subagent provides self-reporting:
- **Completion Percentage**: Estimated progress through phase
- **Current Task**: What the subagent is currently implementing
- **Time Remaining**: Estimated time to phase completion
- **Resource Usage**: Current Sonnet 4 hours consumed
- **Quality Status**: Self-assessed code quality and test status

#### Resource Threshold Management
```
Subagent Resource Alerts:
- 60% weekly Sonnet 4: Continue with current pace
- 75% weekly Sonnet 4: Prioritize core features only
- 85% weekly Sonnet 4: Switch to minimal viable implementation
- 95% weekly Sonnet 4: Complete current phase, defer polish
```

### Success Probability with Subagents

| Outcome | Probability | Resource Usage | Notes |

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: Rate Limit Reality Check (July 30, 2025)

### **Rate Limit Crisis: What Actually Happened**

**PLANNED vs REALITY:**
```markdown
Phase 3 CLI Session:
├── PLANNED: 5 hours (1:00 CT - 6:00 CT), 5-7 Sonnet hours
├── ACTUAL: Hit rate limit at ~3.5 hours during development
├── CAUSE: CLI complexity underestimated, no real-time tracking
└── IMPACT: Development flow completely disrupted
```

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
1. **Estimation Failure**: CLI GitHub integration 40-50 prompts/hour (not 30-40 planned)
2. **No Usage Tracking**: Flying blind until hitting wall
3. **Conservative Buffer Insufficient**: Need 30% buffer minimum, had ~10%
4. **Session Planning Optimistic**: 5-hour sessions too aggressive

### **REVISED CONSERVATIVE METHODOLOGY**

#### **New Session Limits (MANDATORY)**
```markdown
🚦 CONSERVATIVE SESSION PLANNING:

MAXIMUM SESSION LENGTH: 3.5 hours (not 5 hours)
├── Reasoning: Preserves 30% buffer for unexpected complexity
├── Rate Limit Protection: Stop at 70% of estimated capacity
├── Flow State Protection: Never risk hitting walls during vibe coding
└── Emergency Buffer: Always maintain capacity for urgent work

STOP RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
├── GREEN (0-60%): Continue normally, monitor hourly
├── YELLOW (60-70%): Reduce complexity, prepare stopping point
├── RED (70%+): STOP DEVELOPMENT, create handoff documentation
└── CRITICAL (85%+): ABORT IMMEDIATELY, emergency protocols
```

#### **Real-Time Usage Tracking (REQUIRED)**
```markdown
📊 HOURLY TRACKING TEMPLATE:

Hour 1: [Prompts used] / [Estimated total] = [% of budget]
Hour 2: [Prompts used] / [Estimated total] = [% of budget]  
Hour 3: [Prompts used] / [Estimated total] = [% of budget]
Hour 3.5: STOP POINT - Document handoff

Decision Points:
├── 60% usage: Continue with monitoring
├── 70% usage: Begin graceful completion
├── 80% usage: EMERGENCY STOP
└── 90% usage: ABORT SESSION
```

#### **Updated Phase Estimates (Conservative)**
```markdown
PHASE PLANNING (30% Safety Buffer):

Phase 1 (Foundation): 6-8 hours → 8-10 hours
├── Session 1: 3.5 hours (Architecture + Algorithm)
├── Session 2: 3.5 hours (Implementation + Testing)  
├── Session 3: 1-3 hours (Completion + Buffer)

Phase 2 (Web Interface): 8-11 hours → 10-14 hours
├── Session 1: 3.5 hours (Component Foundation)
├── Session 2: 3.5 hours (Integration + API)
├── Session 3: 3.5 hours (Polish + Testing)
├── Session 4: 0-3.5 hours (Buffer + Completion)

Phase 3 (CLI Tool): 5-7 hours → 7-10 hours ⚠️ UPDATED
├── Session 1: 3.5 hours (Architecture + Basic Commands)
├── Session 2: 3.5 hours (GitHub Integration + Testing)
├── Session 3: 0-3 hours (npm Preparation + Polish)
├── REASON: GitHub integration much more complex than estimated

Phase 4 (Testing): 5-9 hours → 7-12 hours
├── Session 1: 3.5 hours (Test Framework + Unit Tests)
├── Session 2: 3.5 hours (Integration + E2E Tests)
├── Session 3: 0-5 hours (CI/CD + Final Validation)

### **Emergency Protocol for Rate Limit Events**

#### **When Rate Limited:**
```markdown
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. 🚨 STOP all development immediately
2. 📝 Document exact stopping point and progress
3. ⏰ Calculate reset time (5 hours from session start)
4. 📋 Create detailed handoff for next session
5. 🔄 Switch to regular Claude for planning/documentation

HANDOFF DOCUMENTATION:
├── Exact file and line where stopped
├── Current task and next 3 immediate steps
├── Critical decisions made during session  
├── Estimated remaining work
└── Lessons learned for next session planning
```

#### **Session Recovery Planning:**
```markdown
NEXT SESSION PREPARATION:
1. ⏰ Wait for reset + 30 minute buffer
2. 📖 Review handoff documentation thoroughly
3. 🎯 Plan conservative objectives (70% of capacity)
4. 📊 Set up real-time usage tracking
5. 🚦 Define clear stop rules before starting

CONSERVATIVE RESTART:
├── Load context efficiently to minimize startup prompts
├── Plan 3.5 hours MAX (not 5 hours)
├── Track usage every hour during development
├── Stop at 70% usage rate regardless of progress
└── Always maintain emergency buffer capacity
```

### **Vibe Coder Flow Protection**

#### **Core Principles:**
```markdown
🎵 FLOW STATE PROTECTION:

NEVER RISK HITTING RATE LIMITS:
├── Plan conservative sessions (3.5h max)
├── Track usage in real-time every hour
├── Stop at 70% capacity to preserve flow
├── Maintain 30% buffer for unexpected complexity
└── Emergency protocols protect development momentum

PREDICTABLE DEVELOPMENT:
├── Monday-Friday: Max 2 sessions per day (3.5h each)
├── Weekend: Emergency buffer only
├── Session timing: Plan around 5-hour reset cycles
├── Buffer days: Wednesday/Friday for planning
└── Never schedule back-to-back sessions without reset buffer
```

#### **Resource Preservation Strategy:**
```markdown
💎 $100 MAX PLAN PROTECTION:

WEEKLY ALLOCATION:
├── Development Sessions: 7-10 sessions × 3.5h = 24.5-35h per week
├── Planning/Documentation: Use regular Claude liberally
├── Emergency Buffer: 20% capacity reserved for urgent work
├── Complexity Buffer: 30% within each session for unexpected issues
└── Flow Protection: Never exceed conservative estimates

QUALITY vs SPEED:
├── Prefer predictable progress over aggressive timelines
├── Better to complete 80% reliably than risk 100% failure
├── Flow state preservation more valuable than speed optimization
├── Emergency capacity allows for urgent fixes without disruption
└── Conservative planning enables consistent weekly development
```

**This crisis taught us that aggressive planning breaks vibe coding flow. Conservative planning with real-time tracking protects both development momentum and resource limits.**

**NEVER AGAIN: With this tracking system, rate limit surprises are eliminated.**
