## 🎯 REPOSITORY STRATEGY

### Primary Repository Decision
**DECISION**: Use **Organized-AI/starter-stacks** as the main repository

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Aligns with business brand (Organized AI)
- ✅ Professional presentation for users and contributors
- ✅ Centralizes AI development resources under organization
- ✅ Enables team collaboration and contributor management
- ✅ Better for marketing and ecosystem development

### Branch Strategy
```
main (production)
├── develop (development integration)
├── feature/ai-tool-evaluator (current implementation)
├── feature/documentation-updates
├── feature/new-stack-additions
└── release/v1.0.0 (release preparation)
```

## 📋 AUTONOMOUS IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### For Claude Code Phase Integration

#### Repository Setup Commands
```bash
# Initial repository configuration
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Organized-AI/starter-stacks.git

# Create feature branch for evaluator implementation
git checkout -b feature/ai-tool-evaluator
git push -u origin feature/ai-tool-evaluator
```

#### Commit Strategy During Implementation
```bash
# Phase 1: Foundation
git add .
git commit -m "feat(evaluator): implement core evaluation engine and stack database

- Add TypeScript interfaces for UserAnswers and StackRecommendation
- Create evaluation engine with scoring algorithm  
- Populate stack database with 10 AI tool stacks
- Add Zod validation schemas for type safety

Phase 1 complete: evaluation engine processes 5-question assessment"

# Phase 2: Web Interface  
git add .
git commit -m "feat(evaluator): implement Next.js web interface

- Add 5-question evaluation flow with progress tracking
- Create results display with recommendations and alternatives
- Implement API routes connecting to evaluation engine
- Add responsive design with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui

Phase 2 complete: functional web app at localhost:3000"

# Continue pattern for Phases 3-5...
```
