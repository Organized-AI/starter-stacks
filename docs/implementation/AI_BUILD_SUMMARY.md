A practical guide for implementation including:
- Quick start steps for 5PM
- Key files to create/modify
- Implementation order by hour
- Testing checklist
- Code snippets and templates
- Common issues and solutions

### 3. **MASTER_PROMPT.md**
The exact prompt to copy/paste into Claude Code containing:
- Clear implementation instructions
- Phase-by-phase breakdown
- Success criteria
- Technical context
- Starting point (Phase 1: UI)

### 4. **AGENT-ORCHESTRATION/agents/orchestration/prd-analyzer.md**
A complete PRD Analyzer agent that:
- Analyzes project descriptions
- Detects project types
- Selects appropriate agents
- Creates custom workflows
- Reports progress via webhooks
- Integrates with GitHub

## 🎯 What This Enables

1. **For Users**:
   - Describe their app idea in plain text
   - Watch AI agents build their entire codebase
   - Get a complete PR in their GitHub repo
   - Go from idea to code in 2-4 hours

2. **For StarterStacks**:
   - Transform from scaffolding to full code generation
   - Massive value add for users
   - Competitive differentiation
   - Potential premium feature

## 🚀 Implementation Order

1. **Hour 1**: Update Step 6 UI with PRD input
2. **Hour 2**: Add backend orchestration endpoints
3. **Hour 3**: Implement real-time progress tracking
4. **Hour 4**: Test and refine the experience

## 💡 Key Innovation

The PRD Analyzer agent is the secret sauce - it:
- Understands natural language project descriptions
- Intelligently selects the right agents
- Creates custom workflows for each project
- Ensures the right expertise for each project type

## 🎮 Usage Flow

1. User completes Steps 1-5 (repo created)
2. Step 6: Choose "AI-Powered Full Build"
3. Describe project (or use template)
4. Click "Start AI Build"
5. Watch real-time progress
6. Review and merge PR

## 📋 Next Steps at 5PM

1. Open Claude Code in StarterStacks directory
2. Copy the content from `MASTER_PROMPT.md`
3. Paste into Claude Code
4. Follow the implementation phases
5. Test with a simple project first

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

StarterStacks becomes the first platform where users can:
- Sign up
- Connect GitHub
- Describe their idea
- Get a complete, production-ready codebase
- All in one seamless flow!

This transforms StarterStacks from a "starter" tool into a complete development platform powered by AI.
