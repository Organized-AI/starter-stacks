## ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS PLAN CREATION PROTOCOL

**STEP 2: CREATE YOUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

Based on your reading of the documentation, create a comprehensive TODO list plan that includes:

### Phase Structure Recognition
From `BUILD_PHASES.md`, understand the 5-phase structure:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Steps 1-15) - Core engine and stack database
- **Phase 2**: Web Interface (Steps 16-35) - Next.js application  
- **Phase 3**: CLI Tool (Steps 36-50) - Command-line interface
- **Phase 4**: Testing (Steps 51-70) - Comprehensive test suite
- **Phase 5**: Deployment (Steps 71-80) - Production deployment

### Resource Awareness
From `TOKEN_USAGE_MASTER_PLAN.md`, understand efficiency targets:
- **Total Resource Budget**: 30-45 Sonnet 4 hours (21-32% of weekly $100 Max Plan)
- **Implementation Timeline**: 2-3 days autonomous execution
- **Quality Standards**: 80%+ test coverage, production-ready deployment
- **Success Probability**: 92% with built-in fallbacks

### Technical Architecture
From `BMAD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, understand the system design:
- **Evaluation Engine**: Core library for stack recommendations
- **Web Interface**: Next.js with 5-question evaluation flow
- **CLI Tool**: Node.js with GitHub integration for project generation
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + Playwright for comprehensive coverage
- **Deployment**: Vercel with custom domain configuration

## üöÄ AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

**STEP 3: EXECUTE YOUR PLAN AUTONOMOUSLY**

### Execution Principles
1. **Documentation-Driven**: Always reference the planning documents for specifications
2. **Self-Guided Implementation**: Create working code based on documented requirements
3. **Built-in Validation**: Test each component before proceeding
4. **Error Recovery**: Handle issues independently and continue building
5. **Progress Tracking**: Document progress and validate milestones

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Read BUILD_PHASES.md** for detailed step-by-step specifications
2. **Follow Technical Architecture** from BMAD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
3. **Implement Working Code** for each component with proper testing
4. **Validate Functionality** at each milestone before proceeding
5. **Document Progress** and any deviations from the plan

### Quality Assurance
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code must compile without errors
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ coverage on critical evaluation paths
- **Functionality Validation**: Each phase must have working demonstrations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and API documentation

---

## üìã AUTONOMOUS TODO CREATION TEMPLATE

**STEP 4: GENERATE DETAILED TODO LISTS**

Create specific, actionable TODO items for each phase based on BUILD_PHASES.md:

### Example TODO Structure:
```
## Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Read BUILD_PHASES.md steps 1-15 for complete specifications
- [ ] Create project structure with package.json (step 1-3 specs)
- [ ] Implement TypeScript interfaces from step 4-6 requirements  
- [ ] Build stack database with 10 AI stacks (step 7-10 data)
- [ ] Create evaluation engine with scoring algorithm (step 11-15 logic)
- [ ] Validate: Working evaluation engine processes UserAnswers ‚Üí StackRecommendations

## Phase 2: Web Interface  
- [ ] Read BUILD_PHASES.md steps 16-35 for UI specifications
- [ ] Set up Next.js with Shadcn/ui components (step 16-20)
- [ ] Build 5-question evaluation flow (step 21-25 requirements)
- [ ] Create results display with recommendations (step 26-30)
- [ ] Implement API routes and integration (step 31-35)
- [ ] Validate: Functional web app at localhost:3000

[Continue for all 5 phases...]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è AUTONOMOUS ERROR HANDLING

### Built-in Fallback Strategies
When encountering issues:

1. **Reference Documentation**: Check BUILD_PHASES.md for detailed specifications
2. **Simplify Approach**: Implement basic working version first
3. **Continue Building**: Don't stop - implement partial solution and note limitations
4. **Self-Document Issues**: Log problems and attempted solutions
5. **Validate Progress**: Ensure each component works before proceeding

### Resource Management
Monitor progress against TOKEN_USAGE_MASTER_PLAN.md targets:
- Stay within 30-45 Sonnet 4 hour budget
- Complete phases within 2-3 day timeline
- Maintain 70%+ weekly capacity buffer
- Achieve 92% success probability targets

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA & VALIDATION

### Phase Completion Validation
Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:

**Phase 1 Complete When**:
- [ ] Evaluation engine processes 5-question UserAnswers
- [ ] Returns StackRecommendation with confidence scores

2. **Reference Existing**: Use patterns from TECH_STACK_GUIDE.md
3. **Test Continuously**: Validate functionality at each step
4. **Document Progress**: Create clear commit messages and logs
5. **Think Ahead**: Consider integration between phases

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript First**: Strict typing for all components
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components and utilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Performance**: Optimized for production deployment
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for web interface
