## StarterStacks AI-Powered Build Implementation

I need to transform StarterStacks Step 6 from a basic scaffolding tool into an AI-powered complete codebase generator.

**Current State**: Step 6 creates a basic Next.js scaffold
**Desired State**: Step 6 accepts a project description and generates a complete, production-ready codebase using AI agents

### Implementation Plan Overview

I have prepared the following files in the StarterStacks directory:
- `BUILD_PHASES_ORCHESTRATION.md` - Complete implementation plan
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `AGENT-ORCHESTRATION/agents/orchestration/prd-analyzer.md` - Sample PRD analyzer agent

### Phase 1: Update Step 6 UI (Start Here)

Please implement the following changes to Step 6:

1. **Update `components/steps/Step6.tsx`**:
   - Add a toggle between "Basic Scaffold" and "AI-Powered Full Build"
   - When AI build is selected, show a project description input
   - Include template buttons for common project types

2. **Create `components/steps/PRDInput.tsx`**:
   - Large textarea for project description
   - Template selector with 4 options (Social, SaaS, AI App, Marketplace)
   - Character count and validation
   - Submit button that triggers the build

3. **Create `components/steps/BuildProgress.tsx`**:
   - Show build phases (Research â†’ Design â†’ Build â†’ Optimize â†’ Complete)
   - Display active AI agents with progress bars
   - Show files being created in real-time
   - Display final stats and PR link when complete

### Phase 2: Backend Orchestration

4. **Create `app/api/orchestrate/route.ts`**:
   - Endpoint that receives project description
   - Triggers PRD analysis
   - Returns orchestration ID for tracking

5. **Create `app/api/webhooks/build-progress/route.ts`**:
   - Receives progress updates from agents
   - Stores in Redis for real-time updates
   - Broadcasts via Server-Sent Events

### Phase 3: Real-time Progress

6. **Create `app/api/build-progress/[id]/route.ts`**:
   - SSE endpoint for live progress
   - Streams updates to the frontend

7. **Create `hooks/useBuildProgress.ts`**:
   - React hook that subscribes to SSE
   - Updates progress state in real-time

### Key Features to Implement:

1. **Project Templates**:
   - Social Network: "Build a social app with profiles, posts, follows, messaging"
   - SaaS Tool: "Project management with teams, tasks, payments"
   - AI Application: "AI assistant with chat, learning, integrations"
   - Marketplace: "Service marketplace with listings, bookings, payments"

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Show each agent as it activates (with emoji and name)
   - Progress bars for each agent's work
   - File creation feed showing paths and line counts
   - Git commits as they happen

3. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Build happens in a new branch: `ai-generated-codebase`
   - Commits after each agent completes
   - Creates PR when finished

### Success Criteria:
- User can describe their project in Step 6
- System analyzes and selects appropriate agents
- Progress updates in real-time
- Complete codebase is generated
- PR is created in their GitHub repo

### Start Implementation:

Begin with Phase 1 - updating the Step 6 UI component. Focus on getting the toggle and PRD input working first, then we'll add the orchestration backend.

The goal is to give StarterStacks users the ability to go from idea â†’ complete codebase in one seamless flow!

## Additional Context

**Tech Stack**:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Real-time: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- State: React hooks
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (follow existing patterns)

**Existing Code Style**:
- Components in `components/`
- API routes in `app/api/`
- Utilities in `lib/`
- Types in `types/`

Please follow the existing StarterStacks patterns and code style throughout the implementation.

Let's start with updating the Step 6 UI!
